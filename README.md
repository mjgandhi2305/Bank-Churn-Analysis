# Bank Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn in the banking sector, leveraging data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer retention and churn rates, providing actionable insights for improving retention strategies.

### Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in customer behavior.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized **Pandas** and **NumPy** for cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare high-quality data for analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive visualizations created with **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to reveal important insights regarding churn rates.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Leveraged statistical techniques to segment customers based on their likelihood of churn, guiding targeted retention efforts.
- **Churn Prediction**: Delivered a comprehensive report with insights and predictions on churn, helping decision-makers create effective strategies to retain valuable customers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**: For creating visualizations to highlight key trends and correlations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed to identify key churn drivers and perform customer segmentation.

## Dataset
